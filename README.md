# Skill App

This is a flutter app.
You can find the released APK 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va5JAS5j-3YrRR9VMfNC0ubJhdZWTQ-p/view?usp=sharing).

In this Project my aim was to implement fireflutter elements. It has Authentication and fire database. 

The last flutter version on which I tested it is flutter version 2.11.

Here are some of the demos I provided:

In the video above you can see how the app starts and how you can easily edit you name.
All other users can see the information one adds.

If you want to just be an observer you can easily enter as a guest.

Also you can edit, add or delete skills:
